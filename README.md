# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Rendering in Next.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS within a Next.js application.  The problem involves Tailwind classes failing to render without any apparent errors in the console.  This often stems from improper configuration of Tailwind within the Next.js build process.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Try to run the Next.js development server (`npm run dev`). You'll notice that Tailwind classes do not apply correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying and fixing your Tailwind configuration in your Next.js project to ensure that the Tailwind directives are correctly processed during the build. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for a working example. This file demonstrates how to properly configure Tailwind in your `tailwind.config.js` file and integrate it with your Next.js app.
