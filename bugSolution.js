The problem was likely due to an incorrect or missing configuration of the `tailwind.config.js` file and/or the absence of the necessary directives in your `globals.css` (or equivalent) file.  The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind is correctly configured to process your CSS files. 

**Corrected `tailwind.config.js`:**
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

**Corrected `globals.css` (or equivalent):**
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
Make sure that these files exist in your project and that the paths specified in `tailwind.config.js` are correct.  Also ensure you've run `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` to install the necessary dependencies.
